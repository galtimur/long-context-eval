Final datapoint structure:

repo_id
repo_name
project_context (dict - file_path: file_content)
file_context (list of file-content to be completed)
ground_truth (list of completion lines)
completion types (think, whether do we need it as a list. I prefer to have several datasets, each for completion type. Or even take only project-level completion)
